# MicroMouse - Readme

A [MicroMouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse) built for a university school project by Nima Baradaran Hassanzadeh, Xian Chen and Christian FÃ¶rster. The mouse is based on a Raspberry Pi 3B paired with an extension board hosting a STM32F030CC. As such, this project heavily involves sensor communication via I2C, inter-processor communication via UART, as well as a lot of STM32-internal timer and PWM logic. For exact specifics, please feel free to read the documentation.pdf!

# Communcation protocol

In order for the STM32 to be able to abstract away movement and the sensors from the actual solving algorithm, we had to come up with our own communication protocol.

## from master to mouse
    0x1A4 : Initiation sequence
    half byte : command type (current commands range from 0000-0100)
    32 bit param (padding if none needed)

## from mouse to master
    0x1A4 : Initiation sequence
    half byte : sensor (current sensors range from 0000-0110)
    32 bit sensor data
